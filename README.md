# Polaroid 600se adapters

I recently got a Polaroid 600se and wanted to hack it to make it more versatile (and cheaper). 

The ultimate goal is to hack an instax wide camera into a working instax wide back for the 600.

## Models

* `generic-adapter.stl` - Generic Adapter (for use with anything). Glue it onto a CB70, or really anything. 
* `in progress` - A CB70 Adapter (A better adapter for a CB70 that doesn't require glue or whatever)

The models were created using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/). You can play around with them by downloading OpenSCAD and opening the .scad files. OpenSCAD will generate an STL that you can print. 

## Printing

### Materials

I am using PLA - but I imagine there are better materials that are stronger and better for light leaking. I will do some investigations to find out which is best. 

### Printers

I have had good luck printing this locally on my 3d Printer, but obviously not everyone has one. I have also sent it to print via [printathing.com](http://printathing.com). There are lots of ways to print an `stl` file. 

Feel free to recommend the best material or solution.
