# Polaroid 600se adapter

I recently got a Polaroid 600se and wanted to hack it to make it more versatile (and cheaper). 

The ultimate goal is to hack an instax wide camera into a working instax wide back for the 600. 

But first things first...


## Models

there are a couple adapters I am attempting to model:

* Generic Adapter (for use with anything). Glue it onto a CB70, or really anything. 
* A CB70 Adapter (A better adapter for a CB70 that doesn't require glue or whatever)

Let me know if i am missing anything else.
